        <p>The Rotterdam Virtual Energy Lab / Hub is a public, open-source, distributed database for smart meter data.
            Users can contribute their data and in return gain access to a personal energy usage dashboard, detailed
            datasets from all contributors, and cloud-based data analysis tools.</p>

        <p>The primary goal of the Lab/Hub is to make energy data more accessible for the people who actually produce
            this data (i.e. everyone). Obviously, this goal is closely aligned with the movement for self-sovereign and
            community-owned data, a movement that has been growing in recent years thanks to Distributed Ledger
            Technologies such as Blockchains.</p>

        <p>Why is it important for users to have easy access to both their data and that of their peers? Because data is
            currently (overwhelmingly) collected and stored in large, privately owned data silos. These silos are
            informational bottlenecks; their contents is controlled, distributed, and potentially even changed by the
            people who own the silos, not the people who produce the data. We can innovate faster if the data in these
            silos is publically available, and able to be immediately utilized for whatever means.</p>

        <p>The VEL/H is currently in the initial stages of development, We are focussing our efforts on onboarding smart
            meters (beginning to populate the database), as well as build our community. In the coming months we will be
            developing a data explorer and a set of tools for data analysis.</p>

        <p>Obviously we have plans beyond the next few months - you can see our roadmap below for a more detailed
            overview of our long term goals! [to be created]</p>
